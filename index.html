  		  <b>Blockchain Literature Review</b> <br>
    	  Short Paper <br>
    	  Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/TalleyAmir/Short-Papers/blob/master/blockchain-survey.pdf">short survey paper</a> that reviews various blockchain ecosystem designs and created a <a href="https://github.com/TalleyAmir/Annotated-Bibliographies/tree/master/blockchain">GitHub repository</a> with summaries of the papers referenced in the survey. <br>
    	  <br>

    	  <b>Broadcast Encryption Based on the Naor-Reingold PRF</b> <br>
    	  Short Paper <br>
    	  Wrote a <a href="https://github.com/TalleyAmir/Short-Papers/blob/master/nrprf-broadcast.pdf">short research paper</a> that defines a broadcast encryption scheme and proves its security by reduction to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem. <br>
    	  <br>

    	  <b>Padding Oracle Attack</b> <br>
    	  Python <br>
    	  Used the padding oracle attack to decrypt a message encrypted using a block cipher in CBC mode. <br>
    	  <br>

    	  <b>TCP</b> <br>

    	  Implemented the TCP network protocol API from scratch. <br>
    	  <br>

    	  <b>Flag</b> <br>
    	  Go <br>
    	  Given a poorly secured website, discovered vulnerabilities and designed and executed exploits to steal unauthorized information and escalate privileges (e.g. SQL injection, parameter based access control, file injection, cross-site scripting, etc.). <br>
